basic calculator

To Use: 

Use either the mouse or keyboard to enter one operation then press 'Calculate!' or the Enter key. 
Feel free to enter another operation. The calculator will store the previous answer and use it to perform further calculations on. 
If you begin to type a new number without starting a new operation the program will automatically clear your previous entries and start over.

Bugs: 

1. Using the minus button (-) on the 10-key pad will cause the program to load the sign change (+/-) operator. It will then execute if you press Enter or 'Calculate!'. However, if you use the minus button on the regular keyboard (top row of keys) it works fine. 

2. Delete/Backspace does not work

3. After hitting "C" or "CE" on the calculator using the Enter key to calculate will result in a return of 0. However, if you use the mouse to input another function and calculate then you can return to using the 10 key. This also happens on the regular keyboard and will have the same fix.
